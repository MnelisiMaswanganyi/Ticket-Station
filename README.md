## 1. Introduction

The Ticket Station web application is a platform for browsing and booking tickets for various events. This README provides an overview of the core features, design principles, and deployment instructions for this project.

## 2. Features

The Ticket Station web application includes the following core features:

- **Event Listing:** Users can view a list of all upcoming and past events, sorted by date, with the earliest event appearing first.
- **Ticket Selection and Booking:** Users can select their preferred event, view available tickets, and proceed with booking, leading to a confirmation page.
- **User Authentication System:** The application offers user registration and login functionality, ensuring secure access to the platform.
- **Event Search Filtering:** Users can search and filter events based on various criteria.
- **Object-Oriented Design:** The codebase adheres to Object-Oriented Programming principles with classes for Events, Tickets, and Users.

## 3. Object-Oriented Design

The Ticket Station project follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, and it defines classes for the following key entities:

- `Event`: Encapsulates attributes and methods related to events.
- `Ticket`: Represents attributes and methods for handling event tickets.
- `User`: Manages user-related data and functionalities.

This structured design enhances code modularity and maintainability.

## 4. Event Listing

The application presents a user-friendly event listing feature that displays upcoming and past events. Events are sorted by date, ensuring the earliest event appears first. This feature provides users with easy access to event details and availability.

## 5. Ticket Selection and Booking Process

The ticket selection and booking process is designed for simplicity and user-friendliness. Users can choose an event, view available tickets, and proceed with booking. Upon successful booking, the system redirects the user to a confirmation page.

## 6. User Authentication System

The web application integrates a basic user authentication system. Users can register and log in to access the platform securely. Successful authentication redirects users to the homepage.

## 7. Deployment

To ensure accessibility for all users, the Ticket Station web application must be deployed on a live server. A deployment link will be provided to demonstrate the project. Additionally, the entire project should be compressed into a zipped file for review and grading purposes.

## 8. UI and User-Friendliness

We prioritize the aesthetic appeal and user-friendliness of the User Interface (UI). The design aims to provide an intuitive and engaging experience for users.

## 9. JavaScript Best Practices

The project adheres to JavaScript best practices, including ES6 principles. We maintain code quality and readability to ensure a smooth development and maintenance process.


Happy ticket booking!
